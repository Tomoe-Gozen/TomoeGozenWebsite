                  Poised to radically reconfigure the crypto-asset market,
                  non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are revolutionizing our
                  conception of money and value, creating not just entirely new
                  markets but even new economies that are able to scale globally
                  and to discover value in undreamt places, relegating to
                  oblivion fiat currencies and old ways of doing business..

                  Just kidding. The previous paragraph is a parody (if such is
                  possible) of the hype that in the first half of 2021 has come
                  to surround non-fungible tokens. Indeed, the hype has become
                  so overpowering that it may even defy parody. Non-fungible
                  tokens can have legitimacy, and I’ll discuss how that can be
                  at the end of this article. But for now the overwhelming
                  majority of what passes for NFTs is delusion, fueled by the
                  hope of a quick return and the belief that something can be
                  gotten for nothing (or virtually nothing).
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is where I can explain and emphasize the
                  “non-fungibility” property of NFTs. The main difference
                  between NFTs and Bitcoins is the fact that Bitcoins are
                  limited, and fungible (you can trade one Bitcoin with another
                  and both have the same value and price). NFTs are unique but
                  unlimited, and non-fungible (no two artworks are the same).
                  While NFTs can appreciate in value (just like real estate),
                  they cannot be interchanged for another NFT.
                </p>

                <h2>NFT Bidding Terms &amp; Condition of Nuron</h2>
                <p>
                  Warren Buffett famously remarked in 2018 that Bitcoin (and by
                  implication all cryptocurrencies) were “probably rat poison
                  squared.” That seems unduly pessimistic given that
                  cryptocurrencies provide a way of securely moving around
                  things that at least look like currency and that in some
                  locales are actually being used like currency. In Venezuela,
                  for instance, Bitcoin provides one way around the country’s
                  corrupt central bank and the hyperinflation it has created.
                  And in early June of 2021, the El Salvador government even
                  approved Bitcoin as legal tender.

                  While not directly related to NFTs, it’s important to mention
                  some properties of money. Among many properties, money has to
                  be fungible (one unit is viewed as interchangeable as
                  another), and divisible (can be divided into smaller units of
                  value). NFTs are not fungible nor (easily) divisible. For
                  example, a single dollar is easily convertible into four
                  quarters or ten dimes, but currently you cannot divide one NFT
                  (although the blockchain technology behind may allow it in
                  future).{' '}

                <p>
                  The importance of NFTs lies in providing the ability to
                  securely value, purchase and exchange digital art using a
                  digital ledger. NFTs started in online gaming, later with
                  Nike’s patenting of its authenticity (CryptoKicks) and then by
                  the famous Christie’s auction embracing NFT valuation of a
                  digital art piece. NFTs are commonly created by uploading
                  files, such as digital artwork, to an auction market. Just
                  like any other form of art, NFTs are not mutually
                  interchangeable, making them more like “collectible” items.
