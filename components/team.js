            and we have been become a really good friend. He is my mentor and he
            taught me about crypto !! I have been investing in crypto since 2018
            and NFT since July in 2021 last year. üìä

            I met @Shiro Kujira in 2020 and we become close friend too, we both
            love nature so much which is the reason I love hiking. Mostly during
            our day off, we spend the day hiking to see nature and beautiful
            scenery in South Island, New Zealand. üèîÔ∏è
